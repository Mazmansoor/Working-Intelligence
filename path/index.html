        <h1>The Path</h1>
        <p class="intro">Understanding matters more than speed.</p>

        <h2>What is this learning journey?</h2>
        <p>This is a curriculum designed for absolute beginners who want to become real ML builders. It takes you from writing your first line of Python code to understanding the fundamental concepts behind modern AI.</p>

        <h2>Why slow?</h2>
        <p>Most tutorials rush you to "magic" results using complex libraries you don't understand. Here, we build concepts from the ground up. We make mistakes on purpose. We learn to debug. We learn to think.</p>

        <h2>How to use this site</h2>
        <p>Follow the modules in order. Do not copy-paste code. Type it out. Read the error messages. If you get stuck, take a break and come back. The goal is not to finish, but to understand.</p>

        <h2>Who is this for?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Absolute beginners to programming</li>
            <li>Curious professionals</li>
            <li>Future ML and AI builders</li>
        </ul>

        <p>It is <strong>not</strong> for those seeking quick hacks, certificates, or hype.</p>
