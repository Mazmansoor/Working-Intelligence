# Setting Up Your Environment

Before we build, we must prepare our tools.

To learn effectively, you must run code on your own machine. We need two things:

1. **Python**: The language interpreter.
2. **A Text Editor**: A place to write your code.

## 1. Install Python

### Windows
Download the latest version from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
**Important:** During installation, check the box that says *"Add Python to PATH"*.

### macOS
Macs come with Python, but it's often old. Download the latest version from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Linux
You likely already have it. Type `python3 --version` in your terminal.

## 2. Choose a Text Editor
Do not use Word or Notepad. You need a code editor.

* **VS Code**: The industry standard. Powerful, free. [Download here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
* **Thonny**: Great for absolute beginners. Simple, comes with Python built-in. [Download here](https://thonny.org/).

## 3. Verify Your Setup
Open your terminal (Command Prompt on Windows) and type:

```bash
python --version
```

(or `python3 --version` on Mac/Linux)

If you see a number like `Python 3.x.x`, you are ready.
