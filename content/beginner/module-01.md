# Module 1: What Programming Really Is

## The Goal
Before we write code, we must understand the mindset. You are about to learn a new way of thinking.

## 1. Computers are Literal, Not Smart
A computer is a machine that follows instructions. It has no intuition. It has no common sense.

If you tell a human, "Please go to the store," they know you imply "Walk out the door, go to the street, avoid cars, enter the shop."
If you tell a robot "Go to the store," it might walk through the wall because you didn't tell it to open the door first.

**Programming is the act of being precise.**

## 2. Precision vs. Intention
*   **Intention**: What you *want* to happen. ("Make a sandwich")
*   **Code**: The exact steps to make it happen. ("Pick up bread. Pick up knife. Open jar...")

When you start, your code will often fail. This is usually because your *intention* was clear, but your *instructions* were incomplete.

## 3. Errors are Friends, Not Enemies
Beginners fear red text. They see an error message and think, "I broke it" or "I am bad at this."

**This is wrong.**

An error message is the computer trying to help you. It is saying, "I want to do what you asked, but I don't understand this specific part."

*   **Read the error.**
*   **Don't panic.**
*   **Fix the instruction.**

## 4. Activity: The Robot Sandwich
*Note: This is a thought experiment.*

Write down the steps to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
Now, imagine a robot following them literally.
*   Did you say to take the lid off the jar?
*   Did you say to use a knife?
*   Did you say to put the bread pieces together?

If you missed a step, the robot fails. Programming is simply practicing this level of detail.
