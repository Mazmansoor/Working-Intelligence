        <h1>Module 1: What Programming Really Is</h1>
<h2>The Goal</h2>
<p>Before we write code, we must understand the mindset. You are about to learn a new way of thinking.</p>
<h2>1. Computers are Literal, Not Smart</h2>
<p>A computer is a machine that follows instructions. It has no intuition. It has no common sense.</p>
<p>If you tell a human, "Please go to the store," they know you imply "Walk out the door, go to the street, avoid cars, enter the shop."</p>
<p>If you tell a robot "Go to the store," it might walk through the wall because you didn't tell it to open the door first.</p>
<p><strong>Programming is the act of being precise.</strong></p>
<h2>2. Precision vs. Intention</h2>
<ul>
<li>  <strong>Intention</strong>: What you <em>want</em> to happen. ("Make a sandwich")</li>
<li>  <strong>Code</strong>: The exact steps to make it happen. ("Pick up bread. Pick up knife. Open jar...")</li>
</ul>
<p>When you start, your code will often fail. This is usually because your <em>intention</em> was clear, but your <em>instructions</em> were incomplete.</p>
<h2>3. Errors are Friends, Not Enemies</h2>
<p>Beginners fear red text. They see an error message and think, "I broke it" or "I am bad at this."</p>
<p><strong>This is wrong.</strong></p>
<p>An error message is the computer trying to help you. It is saying, "I want to do what you asked, but I don't understand this specific part."</p>
<ul>
<li>  <strong>Read the error.</strong></li>
<li>  <strong>Don't panic.</strong></li>
<li>  <strong>Fix the instruction.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2>4. Activity: The Robot Sandwich</h2>
<p><em>Note: This is a thought experiment.</em></p>
<p>Write down the steps to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.</p>
<p>Now, imagine a robot following them literally.</p>
<ul>
<li>  Did you say to take the lid off the jar?</li>
<li>  Did you say to use a knife?</li>
<li>  Did you say to put the bread pieces together?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you missed a step, the robot fails. Programming is simply practicing this level of detail.</p>
