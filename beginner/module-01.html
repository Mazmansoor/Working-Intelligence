        <h1>Module 1: What Programming Really Is</h1>

        <h2>Computers as Instruction Followers</h2>
        <p>Computers are not smart. They are incredibly fast, but they are literal. They do exactly what you tell them to do, not what you <em>meant</em> for them to do.</p>

        <h2>Precision vs Intention</h2>
        <p>Programming is the art of translating your vague human intention into precise machine instructions. If you want a robot to make a sandwich, "make a sandwich" is intention. "Pick up bread slice, place on counter, open peanut butter jar..." is precision.</p>

        <h2>Errors as Feedback</h2>
        <p>You will see red error messages. Many of them. This is not a failure. It is the computer saying, "I don't understand." Treat errors as helpful clues, not judgments.</p>

        <h2>Fear Removal</h2>
        <p>You cannot break the computer by writing code. Experiment. Type things. See what happens. The worst that happens is an error message.</p>
