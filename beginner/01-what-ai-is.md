# What AI Actually Is

## The Simple Truth
AI systems do not think.
They recognize patterns and generate outputs
based on past data.

Nothing more.
Nothing less.

## A Concrete Example
If you show a model thousands of emails labeled “spam” or “not spam,”
it learns patterns that *often* separate the two.

It does not understand scams.
It understands correlations.

## A First Technical Glimpse
A model learns by adjusting numbers (parameters)
to reduce error on past examples.

This process is called *training*.

## Responsibility Check
If a model only knows the past,
what happens when the world changes?
